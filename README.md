# Julie-JS-Project22-Easy-DELETE-Ajax-ES5

This code runs a simple DELETE request on page load using only ES5 in an asynchronous manner. It points to the JSON Placeholder website, and results are displayed only in the console.

As with my other code repsitories, I'm following Traversy Media's introductory JavaScript course for this also.
